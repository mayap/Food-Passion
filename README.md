Website for sharing recipes and keeping track of what each user cooks

## Short project description 

  Browsing the Internet, we can find many websites where people who are fond of cooking are able to see recipes and prepare them at home. However there are less websites where users have their own space for adding recipes with images and different modifications which they have tried on different recipes.
The application allows people to keep track of the best dishes they have prepared, or just some kind of list which includes what they have cooked. Depending on the confidence of each person and his/her cooking skills, users are able to make their recipes public or keep them private if they want to use the application as a personal tracker of cooking.  

The main user roles (actors in UML) are:
-	**Anonymous User** 
    * Anonymous User can browse the public recipes, register or read the information pages
-	**Registered User** 
    * Registered User can log into the application, add public and private recipes, edit added recipes, /comment or rate on other recipes/
